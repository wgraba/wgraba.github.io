## Bio
I am a Husband :ring:, Father :family_man_woman_girl_girl:, and self-procliamed
Linux nerd :nerd_face: living in Colorado, U.S.

I graduated from the undergraduate Electrical Engineering program at
[Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu) with Honors. and attended the
Digital Signal Processing/Communications graduate program at the
[University of Colorado](https://colorado.edu).

While attending school, I worked as a Manufacturing Engineer at Helix Technology
and [Brooks Automation](https://brooks.com) maintaining manufacturing processes 
and test systems. This led to a position as an Electrical Engineer at Brooks.

While working on USB communication for the 
[835 Vacuum Quality Monitor](https://www.mks.com/f/835-vacuum-quality-monitor),
I discovered my passion for firmware. Since that experience, I have been
working on firmware for embedded systems.
